    Bar chart: Bar charts are useful for displaying categorical data. They represent data using rectangular bars, with the length of each bar corresponding to the frequency or proportion of a category. Bar charts are effective for comparing values across different categories or displaying data over time.

    Histogram: Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of continuous or interval data. They group data into bins or intervals and display the frequency or proportion of data points falling into each bin. Histograms help understand the shape, central tendency, and spread of a dataset.

    Line chart: Line charts are suitable for displaying data over time or a continuous variable. They connect data points with lines, making it easy to observe trends, changes, or patterns. Line charts are commonly used in time series analysis, tracking stock prices, or visualizing data that changes continuously.

    Scatter plot: Scatter plots are useful for analyzing the relationship between two continuous variables. They plot data points as individual dots on a Cartesian plane, with one variable represented on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. Scatter plots help identify patterns, correlations, or outliers in the data.

    Pie chart: Pie charts are effective for representing proportions or percentages of a whole. They divide a circle into sectors, with each sector representing a different category or component. Pie charts are useful for displaying categorical data with clear proportions and making comparisons between categories.

    Box plot: Box plots (also known as box-and-whisker plots) provide a summary of the distribution of continuous data. They display the median, quartiles, and outliers of a dataset. Box plots are useful for comparing multiple datasets, identifying skewness or outliers, and understanding the spread of data.

    Heatmap: Heatmaps use colors to represent values in a matrix or table. They are particularly helpful for visualizing large datasets or displaying relationships between multiple variables. Heatmaps are commonly used in fields such as genomics, data clustering, and correlation analysis.

    Box and Whisker Plot: A box and whisker plot displays the summary statistics of a dataset, including the minimum, maximum, quartiles, and median. It provides a visual representation of the distribution and variability of the data.

    Area Chart: An area chart displays the cumulative total of a variable over time or across categories. It is useful for comparing the total value or proportion of multiple variables or categories.

    Pareto Chart: A Pareto chart combines a bar chart with a line graph. It represents both the frequency or proportion of categories in descending order and the cumulative total. It helps identify the most significant categories contributing to a particular outcome.

    Bubble Chart: A bubble chart displays three dimensions of data using the x-axis, y-axis, and size of bubbles. It is effective for visualizing relationships between three continuous variables.

    Radar Chart: A radar chart, also known as a spider chart or star chart, displays multiple variables on radial axes that originate from a common center. It is useful for comparing and displaying the performance or characteristics of different entities across multiple dimensions.

    Gantt Chart: A Gantt chart is used for project management and scheduling. It displays tasks or activities along a timeline, showing their start and end dates and the dependencies between them.

    Control Chart: Control charts are used in statistical process control to monitor and analyze the variation in a process over time. They plot data points along with control limits to determine if the process is within statistical control or if special causes of variation are present.

    Treemap: A treemap visualizes hierarchical data using nested rectangles. Each rectangle represents a category or subcategory, with the size or color indicating a specific variable or attribute.

    Violin Plot: A violin plot combines a box plot and a kernel density plot. It displays the distribution of a continuous variable, including the median, quartiles, and the density of the data.

    Sankey Diagram: A Sankey diagram represents the flow or movement of data, energy, or resources. It uses arrows or lines with varying widths to indicate the quantity or proportion of the flow between different categories or stages.

    Stem-and-Leaf Plot: A stem-and-leaf plot displays numerical data in a way that preserves the individual data points. It shows the distribution of the data and allows for easy identification of key statistics such as the minimum, maximum, and quartiles.

    Waterfall Chart: A waterfall chart displays the cumulative effect of positive and negative changes to an initial value. It is commonly used for financial analysis to show the breakdown of a starting value into its contributing factors.

    Network Diagram: A network diagram, also known as a graph, illustrates the relationships between entities or nodes. It is useful for representing complex systems, social networks, or interconnected data.

    Scatterplot Matrix: A scatterplot matrix is a grid of scatter plots that displays pairwise relationships between multiple variables. It allows for the examination of correlations and patterns across different variables simultaneously.

    Radial Plot: A radial plot, also known as a spider plot or polar plot, represents multiple variables as axes radiating from a central point. Each variable is plotted on its corresponding axis, and the values are connected to form a shape. It is useful for visualizing and comparing the profiles or attributes of different entities.

    Word Cloud: A word cloud is a visual representation of text data, where the size of each word corresponds to its frequency or importance. It is often used to highlight the most common or significant terms in a given dataset.

    Bubble Map: A bubble map is a geographical visualization that represents data using bubbles of varying sizes on a map. The size of each bubble corresponds to a specific variable, allowing for spatial analysis and comparison.

    Heatmap Matrix: A heatmap matrix, also known as a correlation matrix, displays the correlation coefficients between multiple variables as a grid of colored cells. It helps identify patterns and relationships between variables.

    Mosaic Plot: A mosaic plot is used to visualize the association between two categorical variables. It displays rectangular tiles in a grid, with the area of each tile proportional to the joint frequencies of the categories.

    Tree Diagram: A tree diagram, also known as a decision tree, represents a hierarchical structure or sequence of events. It is commonly used in decision analysis, probability calculations, and data mining.
