1. Line Plot: Use a line plot to show trends over time or to depict continuous data points. It is effective for visualizing data with a clear progression, such as stock prices, temperature variations, or population growth.

2. Bar Plot: Bar plots are suitable for comparing categorical data or discrete variables. Use a bar plot when you want to show comparisons between different groups or categories, such as sales figures for different products or the population of different countries.

3. Histogram: Histograms are useful for displaying the distribution of continuous or discrete data. They group data into bins and show the frequency or count of observations falling into each bin. Histograms are commonly used to analyze data such as exam scores, income distribution, or the frequency of certain events.

4. Scatter Plot: A scatter plot is ideal for exploring the relationship between two continuous variables. It helps identify patterns, correlations, or outliers in the data. Scatter plots are often used in scientific research, social sciences, and finance to visualize data points in a two-dimensional space.

5. Box Plot: Box plots provide a summary of the distribution of continuous data. They show the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in a visually compact manner. Box plots are particularly useful for comparing distributions across different categories or groups, such as comparing the salaries of employees in different departments.

6. Pie Chart: Pie charts are effective for representing parts of a whole or percentages. They are commonly used when you want to show the composition or distribution of categorical data, such as market share of different products or the proportion of different types of crimes in a city.

7. Heatmap: Heatmaps are helpful for visualizing data in a tabular format, where each cell is color-coded based on the values it represents. They are useful for displaying correlations, patterns, or clustering in data, such as analyzing customer behavior or visualizing gene expression levels.

8. Area Chart: Area charts are similar to line plots but emphasize the area beneath the line. They are suitable for showing cumulative data or stacked proportions over time. Area charts are often used to represent the progress of a budget, the market share of different products over time, or the population growth of different regions.
